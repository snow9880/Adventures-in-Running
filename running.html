      <h3>BOSU Hit Workout</h3>
      <h5>December 15, 2016</h5>
        <p>
      With athletic training, I have always been fascinated by what you can do
      with a <a href="https://www.bosu.com/blog">BOSU</a>(both sides used).
      Recently, I came across the <a href="https://www.bosu.com/blog">BOSU blog</a>
      and have been dying to try the new workouts. One of the posts includes
      doing a BOSU HIIT workout. Yesterday, when it was too cold outside to run,
      I opted to stay inside and complete one of the hiit workouts. I completed
      each exercise for 45 seconds and then rested for 15 seconds before moving on
      to the next exercise. In all, it took me about 25 minutes to complete the
      hiit program. By the end, I was exhausted. Every single jump reminded me
      how tired my legs were. It was a great workout! But, my calves are tight
      today, so I'll find a different workout to complete today.
