      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
    I grew up in Colorado Springs, Colorado where I learned to love the outdoors
    and running. I started running in high school and walked on cross-country team
    at the University of Northern Colorado. After a few stress fractures, I gave
    up cross-country to join the Athletic Training program. Athletic Training has
    provided many opportunities to travel and explore the world around me. From
    Indiana to China to Guatemala to Ohio, the advenutres continue. After moving
    to Ohio, I met my fiance, Parker. With the wedding coming, the adventures
    continue. My free time includes running, knitting, cooking, and learning to
    program. I love running marathons and half-marathons, but occasionally will
    run other distances. I also have a secret love of Jelly Beans and almost
    anything sweet. On the weekend, you can find Parker and I in our favorite
    local coffe shop.
